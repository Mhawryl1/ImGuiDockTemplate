# ImGui Docking Template

This repository provides a template for setting up an ImGui-based application with docking support. 
It is designed to help developers quickly bootstrap their projects with a functional and customizable user interface.

## Features

- **Docking Support**: Easily create dockable panels for a flexible UI layout.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Customizable**: Modify and extend the template to suit your project's needs.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for easy integration.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.10 or higher).
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) for window and input handling.
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (included in the template).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/imGuiDockingTemplate.git
   cd imGuiDockingTemplate
   ```

2. Create a build directory and configure the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
